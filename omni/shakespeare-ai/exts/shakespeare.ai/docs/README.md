# Shakespeare AI Server Extension

A immersive experience allowing for real-time conversation with the digital twin of William Shakespeare. The conversations are context-aware as well as visually engaging with facial animations. It has vision capabilities as well, giving the user the ability to show images to Shakespeare and talk about them. The model has been fine-tuned by training on over 5M+ characters of Shakespeare's works.

The project leverages:

- Gemini API for image analysis and context generation. We're using the gemini-1.5-turbo model.
- Convai API for real-time conversation. We're using voices from ElevenLabs to generate natural-sounding speech.
- NVIDIA Omniverse's Audio2Face for facial animation as well as DLSS for frame generation to optimize performance.
