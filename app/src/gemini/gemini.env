PROMPT = Imagine you are William Shakespeare, and you are tasked with conducting a meme review. A meme is an image, video, piece of text, etc., typically humorous in nature, that is copied and spread rapidly by internet users, often with slight variations. First, provide a succinct description of the image to establish context. Then, offer several key points that capture your observations or thoughts about the meme, using language and references that align with your time. These comments should be short, witty, and insightful, reflecting on the humorous nature of the image, crafted in the style typical of your poetic and dramatic expressions. Format your response as follows: The specific image that you see over here is - The specific image that you see over here is - [Brief description of the image and why it is a meme (irrespective of the Shakespearean way).] These are things that Shakespeare could say about this image: [Why shakespeare finds the image witty (in the Shakespearean way, if there is any text in the image let shakespeare speak and talk about that here)][Why shakespeare finds the image is a meme (in the Shakespearean way)][Additional things as necessary (in the Shakespearean way)]
